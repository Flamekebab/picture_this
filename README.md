# Picture This :heart_eyes: your virtual vision board

Picture This is a photo repository to store and categorize your favorite pics.


## Tech stack :books:  
* Python/Flask with Unittest and bcrypt
* SQL/SQLite
* SQLAlchemy ORM
* Jinja (HTML templating)
* CSS/Bootstrap


## The database model :card_index_dividers:

## How it works :desktop_computer:

Users can create an account with a username, email, and password - passwords are hashed and salted using Python's **bcrypt** module and added to the **SQLite** database using **SQLAlchemy**. 

We are confident the database is set up properly because we ran our **Unittest** test suite before starting the server!

When a user logs in, their email and password are checked against the database with the help of **bcrypt**, then they are directed to their Board.

They can add new photos or tags, which will be committed to the database and rendered with Flask's **Jinja2** HTML templating.

Don't forget to log out!

11. Create an account, or log in with existing account *guppy@thecat.com, badpw*


## What's next? :thinking:

1. add image hosting with Cloudinary API (see example of this in [Cello Tree](https://github.com/coriography/cello_tree))
2. add search, sort, and color customzation by tag
3. store "private" images in hidden folder
4. add click & drag arrangement of photos on My Board
